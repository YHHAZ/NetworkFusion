# Detection algorithm for pigmented skin disease based on classifier-level and feature-level fusion

This repository is the official implementation source code for the paper [Detection algorithm for pigmented skin disease based on classifier-level and feature-level fusion](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2022.1034772/full).

## Noting Erratum

Due to an oversight by the authors, the category names in the dataset were incorrectly labeled in the published paper. An erratum has now been published to correct this. The specific errors are shown in the table below:

| Original index | Correct index |
| -------------- | ------------- |
| nv             | akiec         |
| mel            | bcc           |
| bkl            | bkl           |
| bcc            | df            |
| akiec          | nv            |
| vasc           | mel           |
| df             | vasc          |
